# ShoppyGlobe - E-commerce Application

## Overview
ShoppyGlobe is a basic e-commerce application built with React. It allows users to browse products, view product details, and manage a shopping cart. The project demonstrates effective use of React components, state management, and API data fetching.

## Features
- Product listing with categories (e.g., beauty, grocery, fragrances, and furniture)
- Category-based product filtering
- Product detail pages
- Shopping cart functionality
- Data fetching from a public API
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management:** Redux (used for managing application-wide state, including the cart and products)
- **Routing:** React Router for navigation
- **Data Fetching:** JavaScript Fetch API (to retrieve products from the API)
- **Development Tools:** Vite (for fast development)

## Challenges Faced
- **API Integration:** Ensuring smooth integration with the public API and handling errors when product data was missing or unavailable.
- **State Management:** Managing global state efficiently using Redux, especially for handling the cart and filtering products by category.
- **Filtering Logic:** Implementing proper filtering for products while maintaining the integrity of the search functionality.
- **Routing Issues:** Handling dynamic routing for product detail pages without passing route parameters directly, while still ensuring correct fetching of data.
- **UI Design:** Ensuring the application had a clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS, making it visually appealing on different devices.
